# I USED THE HIDEOUT TV APP ON A FIRESTICK AND EARNED $_____

Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/3dApxVOf3mM](https://youtu.be/3dApxVOf3mM)

Hey everyone, it’s Dan from Sidehustle Reliance. Recently I did a video showcasing how HideoutTV performs compared to Loot tv on my phone farm. When looking into this further it appears that the HideoutTV Amazon Firestick app is more profitable, giving up to $2 a day for running the platform on a tv, as that is the case. We recently obtained a Firestick, and we’ll be testing out the HideoutTV passive earning opportunities on the application. Before anyone asks, the TOS states you can only run one instance of HideoutTV per session, so you CAN NOT multi-log. Another to note, I’m not a financial adviser, this is purely for entertainment and education processes.

**Experimenting with HideoutTV Amazon Firestick**

Before we get into this information, I want to give some information. I live in the UK, so results may differ compared to your location. I will be conducting this on a 4K TV and the Amazon Firestick will be powered.

**Setting up HideoutTV Amazon Firestick**

Anyways let’s get started. Firstly it was easy to get this set up, I had to search for the HideoutTV application and install it. The only potential problem was that you have to leave the devices running, and use a lot more power compared to a phone.

**Earnings on HideoutTV Amazon Firestick**

On HideoutTV, you normally gain 3.3 HideoutTV points per advertisement viewed on mobile, but on the tv, you gain around 10 HideoutTV per ad. HideoutTV you normally get a login captcha every 4 hours on mobile, although, on the tv version, it was every hour. With further comparison, I make 600 HideoutTV points per 24 hours on my android phone, but my earnings from the TV are significantly lower. During this controlled environment, I would make 40 HideoutTV points across the 24-hour period.

When monitoring the cost to run this, it ended up using 0.684 K/Wh. This is equal to around 14 cents a day. That does mean that the mobile version is the best way to HideoutTV, due to the phone having a battery. Long story short, stick with the phone version if you can, less cost and more profits.

**Check-in codes on HideoutTV**

One thing to note HideoutTV does offer a daily check-in code. Every day after midnight GMT, there is a daily code you can enter in the rewards section for 9 free HideoutTV points. Free codes also appear on HideoutTV’s Facebook or Instagram page every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 5pm GMT. These promo codes reward users with 25 HideoutTV Points. Just make sure you have your notifications on your favourite social media so you don’t miss out!

**Cashing out**

When cashing out whether the number one thing to do is to cash out to Lootup. This is because Lootup offers a higher cash-out amount than any other rewards platform as they are owned by HideoutTV. When you transfer the points over you normally gain 10 HideoutTV points to 11 Lootup. DO NOT transfer your points until you hit a 50% bonus on the free daily Lootup Wheel, which means when you transfer your points, you’ll end up earning more than otherwise. If you transfer 10,000 HideoutTV points without the bonus, you’d only get $11. With Lootup and the 50% bonus, you’d end up getting $15.50. So it’s vital you maximise this.

**Overview**

Overall it was interesting to look into this experiment, but it does show that in this environment where I tested the firestick, it’s not worth the time or the effort to run. If you do you get a Firestick to get it for the entertainment side of it it’s great, just definitely not the passive earning opportunities. I did have a lot of fun with this video and I will definitely be exploring new exciting ways to earn in 2022 and beyond.
